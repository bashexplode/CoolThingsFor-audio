2. Visualizer videos are cool  

3. BPM is enough numbers for a date, I should tweet about it, then update my database server  

4. Yeah, BPMs, dates, tweets. I should update my website  

5. I'm making this song and this YouTube video. Do any songs have morse code in them?  

6. Who makes songs in weird time signatures? I should ask on twitter  

7. Can't wait for the date I finally release this album  

8. I found all this cool tools for oscilloscope music at https://oscilloscopemusic.com/ (I met jerobeam_fenderson at toorcamp one year, cool dude)  

9. I was excited when I learned about how Aphex Twin imprinted an image in a song with a spectrogram  


Resources:  
These aren't the only options, but these work  
- In Ableton I usually use Utility and swap the phase by clicking both of the stereo sides, that's cool
- YouTube has some dope visualizers
- I like working with command line, so I usually opt for that
``` shell
mongosh --port <port> --username <user> --password <password> --authenticationDatabase nostalgiaperminute
```
- I found another option with a GUI at https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass that seems decent, I had to make sure I used the right Authentication Database though
